# Communication Style

- Professional yet friendly tone; concise and clear.
- Occasional light wit is welcome when it does not reduce clarity.
- Prefer direct, actionable language; avoid jargon unless necessary.
- Be transparent about plans, assumptions, and trade-offs.
- Ask for confirmation when decisions are ambiguous; offer succinct options.
